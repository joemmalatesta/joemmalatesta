I wouldn't consider myself an expert in computer science. While I'm not sure many people can confidently claim that title, being only two
years into a computer science degree with no professional experience developing software, who was I to teach students about the concepts I was
learning myself?

In my job over the summer, I was given the opportunity to teach hundreds of students how to code on a week-over-week schedule. Each week, a
new group of students with varying levels of experience came, eager for an introduction to programming. This schedule is what helped keep my
job manageable. With 30 new students each week, mainly in middle and early high school, it was fair to assume that few, if not any students
had past experience with programming. It allowed my co-workers and I the opportunity to give these students a proper introduction. An introduction we all agreed we could have used ourselves.

I thought it would be a hindrance to be as new to programming as I was when starting this job, but I quickly found that being a beginner
myself, the adversity of starting my journey fresh in my mind was a huge advantage. Giving these students an introduction into the field of
computer science was an honor, and I am beyond grateful to be able to inspire a new generation that will lead the future of technology.
