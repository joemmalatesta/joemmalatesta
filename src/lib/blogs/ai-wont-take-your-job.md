well, it is. But you’ll still have a job.

It’s not often that something new comes along and disrupts everything about everything. There have been major game changers that turn industries on their heads, but aside from the internet itself and perhaps things like railroads or the printing press, no single improvement will have as much impact on the world as AI.

## How industries react to overwhelming change

The process of automating jobs out of existence has been around pretty much forever. The loom put the average weaver out of business, the printing press put the average scribe out of business, and Wordpress put the average web developer out of business. In each of these cases, though, those who were able to adapt to the situation were able to not only last, but flourish even further in their domain, and I see the current and near future state of AI in the same way.

AI won’t disrupt a single market the way these advancements did, but is rather likely to effect almost all conceivable jobs, the same way the invention of the internet did. That said, the principal of adapting to the changing environment holds true. Even now, there are people breaking away from their competition because they are making full use of the new AI tools afforded to them.

## Layoffs

Last year, someone high up in tech finally got smart and decided to remove the excessive bloat that their company had developed, and it started a chain reaction of reviewing employee count in several companies. In several ways, this is powered by AI. Not only can developers and other employees work multitudes faster, but these companies now need more capital to invest into their own AI. Microsoft and Google both had massive cuts this year, likely to lean more into investing and developing AI. Also, companies are inclined to hire people that are using AI to help their productivity. There is no novelty in doing things the old fashioned way when there are superior tools, and those who are not accustomed to using them will fall FAR behind, further than they ever would have before.

## Annoying Caveat

I can spot a GPT generated paragraph from a mile away the same way I can tell that a website is built with Shopify or Wordpress from a quick look. It’s sad to think that previously creative jobs like writing and marketing can, and are generally inclined to, now be automated. The automation of things gives more power to truly special work, like how the loom made artesian workers worth more, but the truly great work will now be few and far between.

## Final thoughts

I’m not some sort of fortune teller, but history says that when jobs go away, new jobs show up. AI will undoubtedly change every aspect of our society, but with a technology that has the capacity to develop more rapidly than anyone could imagine, I shy away from making predictions about anything but the near future. TL;DR - use AI or lose.
