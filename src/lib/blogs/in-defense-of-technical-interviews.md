Technical Interviews are, without doubt, the most loathed part of the interview process. They are meant to meant to measure your coding ability, thought process, and how you approach a problem but have gained a reputation for being an inconsistent exam for regurgitating useless algorithms and data structures. For many, they are the sole thing that deters them from applying at many top companies, barring them from earning a higher salary or a better work life balance. 

### The current state of interviews
There are two main ways programming ability is measured in an interview process. Either a take home assignment, or a technical interview. These each have their pros and cons but, with the advancement of AI, it is reasonable to believe that one could complete a take home test without real knowledge of what they are completing, and the [data shows](https://interviewing.io/blog/technical-interview-performance-is-kind-of-arbitrary-heres-the-data) that performance on technical interviews is largely inconsistent, varying from interview to interview. Even with that said, I don't think that the current technical interview is as bad as people make it out to be.

### The structure is actually pretty good
In terms of measuring coding ability and thought process, an in person / realtime interview is a companies best bet. It's a good opportunity to display your thoughts and ability in a sample "working environment" and gauge if you can mesh well with the team, and with hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line, it is fair to assume that cheating on an asynchronous project or interview is commonplace. While I agree with the way the interview is held, I don't agree with the questions that are asked, or the expectation placed on the interviewee.

### My suggestion
If the goal of the technical interview is to simply see how candidates would go about solving a problem, and the steps they would take to reach a conclusion, there should not have to be code written and tested. Memorizing sorting algorithms, their time complexity, and how to implement them should not be the benchmark for earning a well paying job. Instead, companies should care more about the thought process of the candidate, and their ability to fully think problems through with the businesses goals in mind. It is well understood by programmers that the ability to ask good questions is more important than the ability to write the code. Instead of judging candidates by their ability to memorize a Leetcode problem, give them room to actually think and, pose a technical question that could realistically be asked of them on the job.

#### Conclusion

As a whole, technical interviews get a bad rap because people feel as though it doesn't reflect a true working environment. It shares the sentiment with college math courses, the "when will I ever use this information" kind of sentiment. If you break it down though, technical interviews actually have a great structure for weeding out candidates, but the questions need to be much more generalized and take into account specific company goals.
