description: A guide on winning hackathons

---
For two years I’ve been involved in hackathons as both an organizer and a participant. I’ve pitched and been pitched dozens of winning projects and they all have one thing in common - they’re *never* the most technical. Instead, they all have something that makes them memorable - An entertaining demo, a unique idea, or a clever technical solution. But first, who am I and why do I get an opinion?

- [Won 4/4 hackathons](https://devpost.com/joemmalatesta)
- 2 first place finishes, wins at 2 of the largest hackathons in the US
- Won with 4 completely different ideas
- Won with 0, 1, 2, and 3 teammates
- Directed and judged [my own schools hackathon](https://six.grizzhacks.org)

Over time, I curated a list of rules that I've personally used to win 100% of my hackathons, and things that hold true for every winning project I have seen. I want to start this with some common things I hear people say about why they **Can't** win a hackathon.

### Misconceptions
> “You have to be **Cracked**”

First, stop using that word, it has no meaning. Second, you don’t. I had randoms clowning me on TikTok about how simple my first hackathon project was (which won 1st place overall). A strong demo/idea can carry a boring codebase.

> “I need a strong team to help build x, y, and z features”

Before looking for people who will likely disagree with you and slow you down, first think - Do I really need x, y, and z?

> “There’s so many people here, I could never win”

I had this thought at CalHacks (2000+ people) and still won with a half baked project. Realistically, 50% of people will be demoing just an idea, broken project, or some boring fintech app that has judges spacing out.

> “I can’t finish a whole project in 24 hours”

Unless it’s your first time using a text editor, you can likely glue enough code together to get something pretty and functional for a handful of use cases (and that’s really all you need).

## Rules for a winning project
### 1. Start with the demo
To host a good hackathon, you're told "every decision should have the hacker in mind". Likewise for a good project, every decision should have the judges in mind. As harsh as it may sound, the 5 minute demo determines what your last 23 hours of work were worth. For [Cheddarboxd](https://devpost.com/software/cheddarboxd), I knew I was going to feed the judges cheese before I even touched down in Dallas.

### 2. Build 10% of what you initially planned
"Wouldn't it be cool if it _______?" Yeah, wouldn't it be cool if your project actually worked? Remember when I said 50% of projects are half baked? Here's the main culprit. Ever project I've made has had 2-3 well built features and nothing else. 

### 3. Be Unique in idea, implementation, or demo
You're not going to beat 100+ teams without being memorable to the judges. Luckily, there are a few ways to do this.

### 4. Prefer no team to a stubborn team
As much as I love hackathons, it has never been a place for true collaboration. 

### Random Quick Tips
- NEVER train your own model. Zero shot does the trick for 99% of use cases
- NEVER actually implement auth if it’s not a core feature
- NEVER put static content on the site. No better way to bore the judge than saying “Here’s a tips page with extra info on ____”


### What does a win mean, anyway?

I say all of this just to say that winning prizes doesn't actually matter. At an event like this, there are dozens of ways to "win". For some people, winning could be meeting new people, learning a new skill, or even just doing the midnight karaoke. Anecdotally, I have a friend who won in a completely different way. He spent all of his time at hackathons meeting people and before he had ever won a prize, he secured an internship from connection he made at a hackathon. In order to compete for prizes, I always had to give up some of the more fun things hackathons have to offer.
