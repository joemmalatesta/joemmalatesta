description: A guide on winning hackathons

---
For two years I’ve been involved in hackathons as both an organizer and a participant. I’ve pitched and been pitched dozens of winning projects and they all have one thing in common - they’re *never* the most technical. Instead, they all have something that makes them memorable - An entertaining demo, a unique idea, or a clever technical solution. Before I give advice, why should I get an opinion?

- [Won 4/4 hackathons](https://devpost.com/joemmalatesta)
- 2 first place finishes, wins at 2 of the largest hackathons in the US
- Won with 4 completely different ideas
- Won with 0, 1, 2, and 3 teammates
- Directed and judged [my own schools hackathon](https://six.grizzhacks.org)

Over time, I curated a list of rules that I've personally used to win 100% of my hackathons, and things that hold true for every winning project I have seen. I want to start this with some common things I hear people say about why they **Can't** win a hackathon.

### Misconceptions
> “You have to be **Cracked**”

First, stop using that word, it has no meaning. Second, you don’t. I had randoms clowning me on TikTok about how simple my first hackathon project was (which won 1st place). A strong demo/idea can carry a boring codebase.

> “I need a strong team to help build x, y, and z features”

Before looking for people who will probably slow you down (more on that later), first think - Do I really need x, y, and z?

> “There’s so many people here, I could never win”

I had this thought at CalHacks (2000+ people) and still won with a half baked project. Realistically, 50% of people will be demoing just an idea, a broken project, or some boring fintech app that has judges spacing out.

> “I can’t finish a whole project in 24 hours”

Unless it’s your first time opening a text editor, you can likely glue enough code together to get something pretty and functional for a handful of use cases (and that’s really all you need). You can absolutely win as a beginner and lots of hackathons have specific beginner prizes.

## Rules for a winning project
### 1. Start with the demo
To host a good hackathon, you're told "every decision should have the hacker in mind". For a good project, every decision should have the judges in mind. As harsh as it may sound, the 5 minute pitches determine what your last 23 hours of work were worth. Focus solely on making it concise, cohesive, and memorable. Personally, I love having the judges interact with my app live. For [Cheddarboxd](https://devpost.com/software/cheddarboxd), I knew I was going to have judges try cheeses before I even touched down in Dallas, and built the app around that image.

### 2. Build 10% of what you planned
"Wouldn't it be cool if it _______?" Yeah, but it'd be way cooler if it actually worked. Remember when I said 50% of projects are half baked? Here's the main culprit. Your project should have only a handful of **well built** features (remember your demo is 3-5 mins).

### 3. Be Unique in idea, implementation, or demo
There is 2 parts to judging. Initial rankings and then deliberation. If you've ever been sitting around waiting for results for an hour or two, there is a conversation happening behind the scenes about who should win. 


You're not going to beat 100+ teams without being memorable to the judges. Luckily, there are a few ways to do this.

### 4. Prefer no team over a stubborn team
As much as I love hackathons, it has never been a place for strong collaboration. You'll often see winners with teams, but those teams are usually formed far before the start date, or with one strong leader and a pre worked idea. By and large, random teammates cause more bad than they do good. Difference in opinion and skill set can easily cause conflict early on and without initial momentum, teams often fall apart midway through the hacking time, setting you back even further.

### Quick Do's and Don'ts
- DON'T train your own model. Zero shot does the trick for 99% of use cases
- DON'T actually implement auth if it’s not a core feature
- DON'T put static content on the site. No better way to bore the judge than saying “Here’s a tips page with extra info on ____”
- DO make a [PWA](https://www.joemmalatesta.com/writing/sveltekit-pwa), they are insanely high ROI. They're easy to implement, not well known, and will impress the judges consistently. 
- DO use outside tools/props. There is a conversation to be had about the unfair, inherent benefits that come with this, but if it's allowed, use it. [First place at CalHacks](https://devpost.com/software/duet-0tbkxe) made good use of an EEG.
- DO include a video, github, decent Devpost submission. Judges use it to help make final decisions, and if your demo goes bad


### What does a win mean, anyway?

I say all of this just to say that winning prizes doesn't actually matter. At an event like this, there are dozens of ways to "win". For some people, winning could be meeting new people, learning a new skill, or even just doing the midnight karaoke. Anecdotally, I have a friend who won in a completely different way. He spent all of his time at hackathons meeting people and before he had ever won a prize, he secured an internship from a connection he made at a hackathon. In order to compete for prizes, I always had to give up some of the more fun things hackathons have to offer.
