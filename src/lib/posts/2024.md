In late 2023 I made a small snowball and rolled it down a random hill. Every significant thing that happened to me in 2024 stemmed from that small snowball. The simple decision to ask about my schools hackathon led to: 

- A dream internship in San Francisco
- Meeting 3 of my best friends, and others all over the world
- 4 Hackathons attended, 4 Hackathons won
- $2000 in prizes, trips to California and Texas to compete
- A true sense of ownership, a taste of leadership, and seeing hard work pay off in real time

## In 2024 I said I would…
These blogs have been long as hell in the past. Here's a quick fire recap of if I kept my promises to myself

- Graduate ✅
- First internet dollar ✅
    - I think I meant this more as start a business but I did a dodgy freelance thing so technically complete
- Speak at a conference ✅
    - Not physically sadly but I did do a workshop at a proper online conference with Sentry (Frontend Nation)
- Trying out GoLang ❌
    - Honestly still meaning to but no real reason to as of now
- Full project with NextJs ✅
    - Actually a few and man, it still sucks. Patiently waiting for the patterns to click

## In 2025 I hope I...

- Move out of Michigan fully
    - It’s either that or I find some underground tech scene but AFAIK there’s not enough to scratch that itch here
- Involve myself in a startup
- Learn a bit of hardware
- Actually enjoy coding again (Github graph looking concerningly bleak right now)
- Get good at Leetcode (crazy pipe dream)
- Genuine attempt at learning a new language (spoken)
- Dunk a basketball

2024 was amazing. There's no reason 2025 shouldn't be better. This is a month late. I don’t give a fart.
