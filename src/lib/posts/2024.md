In late 2023 I made a small snowball and rolled it down a random hill. Every significant thing that happened to me in 2024 stemmed from that small snowball. The simple decision to ask about my schools hackathon led to: 

- A dream internship in San Francisco
- Meeting 3 of my best friends, and others all over the world
- 4 Hackathons attended, 4 Hackathons won
- $2000 in prizes, trips to California and Texas to compete
- A true sense of ownership, a taste of leadership, and seeing hard work pay off in real time

In a second here you'll see that none of what *actually* made 2024 so great had really anything to do with the goals I had set the year prior. While I do think it's somewhat important to have some north stars, things that *if you do them* will allow you to make progress, it wouldn't be in my spontaneous, [if not now, then when](https://ifnotnow.tw) mentality to try and plan a whole year in advance. So, the goals I'm setting for 2025 are not so much pass fail as they are "Hey, if you actually do this you'd be a bit better off". I digress.


## In 2024 I said I would…
- Graduate ✅
- First internet dollar ✅
    - I think I meant this more as start a business but I did a dodgy freelance thing so technically complete
- Speak at a conference ✅
    - Not physically sadly but I did do a workshop at a proper online conference with Sentry (Frontend Nation)
- Trying out GoLang ❌
    - Honestly still meaning to but no real reason to as of now
- Full project with NextJs ✅
    - Actually a few and man, it still sucks. Patiently waiting for the patterns to click

## In 2025 I hope I...

- Move out of Michigan fully
    - It’s either that or I find some underground tech scene but AFAIK there’s not enough to scratch that itch here
- Involve myself in a startup
- Learn a bit of hardware
- Actually enjoy coding again (Github graph looking concerningly bleak right now)
- Get good at Leetcode (crazy pipe dream)
- Genuine attempt at learning a new language (spoken)
- Dunk a basketball
- Get a hobby outside of coding and sports. Something creative perhaps.

2024 was amazing, but there's no reason 2025 shouldn't be better. The way I see it, I have this big ass snowball I got from rolling it down Mt. Hackathon, and now it's just a matter of finding another hill to keep it growing.
